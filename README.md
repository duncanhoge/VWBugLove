VWBugLove

ABOUT:

Share your love for the VW Bug with other owners through a digital Blumenvasen. Bug Love is a small closed product that stands in for the Blumenvasen that VW got rid of in their newer models of VW Bugs. VW Bug owners can send out a pulse of Bug Love to other VW Bug drivers, sending their own customized gift to those in range. A scale of LEDs indicates the amount of love a given owner gets, but it all fades over time. Keep the love alive by sharing it with other owners. Apps will allow users to send their love when they are not in the car and will let them see the items they were given from other Bug owners.
